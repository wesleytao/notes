## Adherence / Frequency (Strong stats)

| Window | Training days | Sessions | Days/week | Sessions/week | Avg session (min)\* | Median session (min)\* |
|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| Last 28 days | 15 | 17 | 3.75 | 4.25 | 3.13 | 0.00 |
| Last 84 days | 32 | 34 | 2.67 | 2.83 | 1.56 | 0.00 |
| Last 168 days | 66 | 69 | 2.75 | 2.88 | 0.77 | 0.00 |

\*Session duration in the export is unreliable (many sets share identical timestamps), so treat duration metrics as **low confidence**.

## Most Recent Session (2026-02-21)
- **Workout:** Weak Back  
- **Duration:** ~53 min (from first/last timestamp)  
- **Sets:** 12  
- **Weighted volume (lb·reps):** 3,120  

**Exercise breakdown**
| Exercise | Sets | Reps | Max weight | Volume (lb·reps) |
|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| chest support row | 4 | 48 | 45 | 2,160 |
| Facepull to external rotation | 2 | 24 | 40 | 960 |
| Banded Shoulder Circle | 2 | 30 | 0 | 0 |
| Pull Up (Assisted) | 4 | 34 | 0 | 0 |

**Coach interpretation:** Session is upper-back + rear-delt + shoulder health. Vertical pull intensity is **unknown** because assisted pull-ups are logged without assistance load.

## Strength (best set in last 84 days → Epley est. 1RM)
| Exercise | Best set | Est. 1RM (Epley) | Date | Workout |
|:--|:--|--:|:--|:--|
| Squat (Barbell) | 275 × 13 | 394.2 | 2025-12-07 | Leg |
| Bench Press (Barbell) | 185 × 13 | 265.2 | 2025-12-29 | chest at SF |
| Pull Up | 171 × 16 | 262.2 | 2025-12-30 | back |
| Bent Over Row (Barbell) | 155 × 18 | 248.0 | 2025-12-30 | back |
| Incline Bench Press (Barbell) | 165 × 8 | 209.0 | 2026-02-15 | Morning Workout |
| Pull Up (Assisted) | 50 × 10 | 66.7 | 2026-02-16 | Morning Workout |

**Coach note:** The “Pull Up = 171 × 16” entry likely reflects **machine/assisted recording quirks** (not true bodyweight pull-ups). Needs clarification.

## Workload Trend (last 12 weeks, weighted tonnage)
| Week | Weighted tonnage (lb·reps) | Weighted sets | Reps |
|:--|--:|--:|--:|
| 2025-12-01 | 35,330 | 15 | 157 |
| 2025-12-08 | 68,888 | 46 | 509 |
| 2025-12-15 | 84,331 | 80 | 969 |
| 2025-12-29 | 45,630.5 | 44 | 538 |
| 2026-01-05 | 37,480 | 25 | 289 |
| 2026-01-12 | 52,940 | 39 | 439 |
| 2026-01-19 | 21,520 | 25 | 280 |
| 2026-01-26 | 32,612 | 44 | 482 |
| 2026-02-02 | 34,905 | 38 | 402 |
| 2026-02-09 | 117,516 | 135 | 1,451 |
| 2026-02-16 | 24,660 | 45 | 474 |

**Coach note:** There’s a major spike week (2026-02-09). Worth checking if it’s a true high-volume block or logging artifact.

## Exercise Emphasis (last 28 days)
Top exercises by number of sessions appearing in:
| Exercise | Sets | Sessions |
|:--|--:|--:|
| Pull Up (Assisted) | 18 | 6 |
| Incline Bench Press (Dumbbell) | 16 | 5 |
| Facepull to external rotation | 8 | 4 |
| Bench Press (Barbell) | 15 | 3 |
| Lat Pulldown (Cable) | 11 | 3 |
| Triceps Extension (Cable) | 10 | 3 |
| Chest Dip (Assisted) | 9 | 3 |
| Pec Deck (Machine) | 9 | 3 |
| Seated Overhead Press (Dumbbell) | 9 | 3 |
| Triceps Pushdown (Straight Bar) | 9 | 3 |
| Banded Shoulder Circle | 6 | 3 |

**Coach interpretation:** Emphasis skews toward **upper body pushing + assisted vertical pull + shoulder health**. Lower-body frequency is not obvious from top-28d exercise list (may still exist, just not top frequency).

## Data Quality / Logging Issues (Strong export)
- **Sets with missing/zero weight:** 4.2%  
- **Sets with missing/zero reps:** 2.0%  
- Biggest gap: **assisted pull-ups/dips logged with 0 load or inconsistent load**, so vertical pull/push workload and strength are under-measured / confusing.

**Coach request (high leverage):**
- For assisted moves, always log either **assistance weight** (machine) or **band type**, so progress is measurable.
- For key lifts, log **top set RPE** at least.
