# Training Plan — 4-Day Split with Progressive Overload

## Progressive Overload Protocol

Applied to **one compound lift per session** (marked with ⭐ below).

| Phase | Sets | Intent |
|-------|------|--------|
| Warm-up | 2–3 ramp-up sets | Not to failure. Clean reps, building to working weight. |
| Top Set | 1 set to technical failure | The money set. Push until form breaks. |
| Back-off Set | 1 set at ~65–70% of top set | Hard work, not sloppy. Higher reps. |

### Double Progression (10 → 15)

1. Pick a weight you can hit for **~10 reps** on the top set.
2. Each session, try to add reps at the same weight.
3. Once you hit **15 reps**, increase weight next session — reps will drop back to ~10.
4. Repeat.

### If You Stall Short of the Rep Target

If you get close (e.g., 13 out of 15), pick one:

- **Partial reps** — 2 reps in a safe range of motion
- **Rest-pause** — rack/stop for 10 seconds, then finish remaining reps

## Day 1 — Legs

| # | Exercise | Sets | Protocol |
|--:|----------|-----:|----------|
| ⭐ | **Barbell Squat** | 4 | Progressive overload (warm-up → top set → back-off) |
| 2 | Leg Press | 3 | Straight sets |
| 3 | Leg Extension (Machine) | 3 | Straight sets |
| 4 | Lying Leg Curl (Machine) | 4 | Straight sets |

**Squat progression example:**

| Set | Load | Reps | Notes |
|----:|-----:|-----:|-------|
| 1 | 45 lb | — | Bar only |
| 2 | 95 lb | 10 | Warm-up |
| 3 | 135 lb | 6–8 | Warm-up |
| 4 | 185 lb | 10–15 | **Top set — to technical failure** |
| 5 | 125 lb | 10–12 | **Back-off set** |

> **Squat "failure" = technical failure.** Stop when depth changes, knees cave, back rounds, or bar path gets ugly. Don't grind ugly reps.

## Day 2 — Upper Chest & Triceps

| # | Exercise | Sets | Protocol |
|--:|----------|-----:|----------|
| ⭐ | **Incline Bench Press (Barbell)** | 4 | Progressive overload (warm-up → top set → back-off) |
| 2 | Incline Bench Press (Dumbbell) | 3 | Straight sets |
| 3 | Pec Deck (Machine) | 3 | Straight sets |
| 4 | Chest Dip (Assisted) | 3 | Straight sets |
| 5 | Triceps Extension (Cable) | 3 | Straight sets |

**Incline barbell bench progression example:**

| Set | Load | Reps | Notes |
|----:|-----:|-----:|-------|
| 1 | 65 lb | 10 | Warm-up |
| 2 | 95 lb | 8 | Warm-up |
| 3 | 135 lb | 10–15 | **Top set — to technical failure** |
| 4 | 95 lb | 10–12 | **Back-off set** |

## Day 3 — Back (Weakness Focus)

| # | Exercise | Sets | Protocol |
|--:|----------|-----:|----------|
| — | Banded Shoulder Circle | 2 | Warm-up / activation |
| — | Face Pull to External Rotation | 2 | Warm-up / activation |
| ⭐ | **Pull-Up (Assisted)** | 4 | Progressive overload (warm-up → top set → back-off) |
| 2 | Chest-Supported Row | 3 | Straight sets |
| 3 | Incline Row (Dumbbell) | 3 | Straight sets |
| 4 | Lat Pulldown (Single Arm) | 3 | Straight sets |
| 5 | Face Pull (Cable) | 3 | Straight sets |

**Pull-up progression — how it works differently:**

Instead of adding weight, you **reduce assistance**.

| Set | Assistance | Reps | Notes |
|----:|------------|-----:|-------|
| 1 | Heavy assist | 8–10 | Warm-up |
| 2 | Moderate assist | 6–8 | Warm-up |
| 3 | Target assist level | 10–15 | **Top set — to technical failure** |
| 4 | Heavier assist | 10–12 | **Back-off set** |

> **Double progression for pull-ups:** Keep the same assistance level until you can hit 15 clean reps on the top set. Then reduce assistance by one notch — reps will drop back to ~10. Repeat.

## Day 4 — Biceps & Shoulders

| # | Exercise | Sets | Protocol |
|--:|----------|-----:|----------|
| — | Banded Shoulder Circle | 2 | Warm-up / activation |
| — | Face Pull to External Rotation | 2 | Warm-up / activation |
| 1 | Hanging Leg Raise | 3 | Straight sets |
| 2 | Crunch | 3 | Straight sets |
| 3 | Lateral Raise (Cable) | 4 | Straight sets |
| 4 | Incline Curl (Dumbbell) | 3 | Straight sets |
| 5 | EZ Bar Curl | 4 | Straight sets |
| 6 | Lateral Raise (Machine) | 3 | Straight sets |
| 7 | Incline Bench Press (Dumbbell) | 3 | Straight sets |

> No progressive overload compound designated for this day — it's an isolation-heavy session. Apply double progression to lateral raises and curls by tracking weight/reps normally.

## General Notes

- **Warm-ups are practice, not punishment.** Keep them clean and submaximal.
- **Back-off sets** should feel like hard work, but not a sloppy near-death experience.
- **Rest periods:** 2–3 min before top sets on compounds. 60–90 sec for isolation work.
- **Compounds (squat, bench, pull-ups):** failure = technical failure. Stop when form breaks.
- **Isolation work (curls, extensions, raises):** you can push closer to true muscular failure safely.
- **Log everything.** Weight, reps, and RPE on the top set. This is how you know when to progress.
