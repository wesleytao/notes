## Lessons From the Last Prep

You showed up 4 weeks too soft. That means one or more of the following happened:

1. The deficit started too late or too shallow
2. Adherence slipped in ways that weren't accounted for (the weekly cheat meal alone can erase 2–3 days of deficit)
3. No cardio or step tracking meant you had no secondary lever when fat loss stalled
4. Getting sick at ~4 weeks out suggests you were under-recovered — possibly from a panic-cut stacking multiple stressors simultaneously

Your old training program also wasn't competition-specific. It was general hypertrophy (chest/bicep splits, no delt or back emphasis, percentage-based progression with AMRAP test weeks). The exercises were fine but the volume allocation didn't target what MP judges score.

**This plan prevents all four of those problems.**
