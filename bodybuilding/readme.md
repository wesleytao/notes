# 28-Week Men's Physique Contest Prep Plan (v2)

*Calibrated with Strong app training data (465 sessions, 2022–2026). Corrections applied from coaching review.*



# Goal

**Division emphasis (what judges score):** V-taper (wide shoulders → narrow waist), lateral and rear delt fullness, upper chest, lat width, tight midsection, stage presence and flow.

**What judges don't see:** Quads, hamstrings, calves (board shorts cover them). You still train legs for health and proportionality, but they are not a priority.

**Conditioning target:** 8–10% body fat. Lean, dry, full — not emaciated.

**Realistic stage weight:** 148–151 lbs. At 136 lbs lean mass, 10% BF = ~151 lbs, 8% BF = ~148 lbs. That's 21–24 lbs of fat loss over 28 weeks (~0.75–0.85 lb/week average). This is achievable without aggressive muscle loss if the deficit is managed properly.

## Weekly Split

**5 training days. Upper body biased. One leg day (sufficient for MP).**

| Day | Session | Purpose |
|-----|---------|---------|
| 1 | Upper A — Chest + Back (Heavy) + Lateral Delts | Primary pressing + heavy rowing + delt volume |
| 2 | Lower — Full Leg Day | Squat + hinge + maintenance volume |
| 3 | Rest | Steps only (weeks 28–26). Steps + conditional LISS (week 26+). |
| 4 | Upper B — Shoulders + Arms | Delt priority + arm work |
| 5 | Upper C — Back + Rear Delts + Lateral Delts | Weak point blitz: lat width + mid-back thickness + delt volume |
| 6 | Rest | Steps + posing |
| 7 | Active Recovery | Posing + optional light pump work |

---

## Day 1 — Upper A: Chest + Back (Heavy) + Lateral Delts

| # | Exercise | Working Sets | Rep Range | Starting Weight (Phase 1) | Notes |
|--:|----------|:------------:|:---------:|:-------------------------:|-------|
| ⭐ | Incline Bench Press (Barbell) | 3→2 | 5–8 / 8–12 | Top: 155 lb / Back-off: 135 lb | Progressive overload. Upper chest is an MP priority. You recently hit 165×8 — start at 155 to establish the rep scheme, then push. |
| 2 | Chest-Supported Row | 3 | 8–12 | 45 lb DBs (per hand) | **Weak point.** You did 4×12 at 45 lb on Feb 21. Squeeze scapulae hard, 2s hold at contraction. Elbows wide for mid-back. |
| 3 | Incline Bench Press (Dumbbell) | 2 | 8–12 | 55–60 lb DBs | Reduced from 3 → 2 sets to free volume for lateral delts. Full stretch at bottom. |
| 4 | Incline Dumbbell Row | 3 | 8–12 | 40–45 lb DBs | Pronated grip, drive elbows wide. Mid-back thickness. |
| 5 | Pec Deck (Machine) | 3 | 12–15 | Per current working weight | Deep stretch, controlled squeeze. |
| 6 | Face Pull (Cable) | 3 | 15–20 | 40 lb | Rear delt + external rotation health. |
| 7 | Lateral Raise (Cable or DB) | 3 | 15–20 | 15 lb | **Added.** High reps, chase the pump. Delt volume distribution. |

**Session volume:** Chest 8 sets | Back 9 sets | Rear delts 3 sets | Lateral delts 3 sets

---

## Day 2 — Lower: Full Leg Day

| # | Exercise | Working Sets | Rep Range | Starting Weight (Phase 1) | Notes |
|--:|----------|:------------:|:---------:|:-------------------------:|-------|
| ⭐ | Barbell Squat | 3→2 | 5–8 / 8–12 | Top: 245 lb / Back-off: 225 lb | You hit 275×13 in December. Start at ~62% for back-off, ~72% for top set. Technical failure only. One leg day/week means every top set counts — keep it hard but clean, not "cardio with a barbell." |
| 2 | Romanian Deadlift (Barbell) | 3 | 8–12 | 185 lb | Based on your deadlift history (345 1RM). Hamstring-glute tie-in. Stop before back rounds. |
| 3 | Leg Extension (Machine) | 3 | 12–15 | Per current working weight | Squeeze at top. |
| 4 | Lying Leg Curl (Machine) | 3 | 12–15 | Per current working weight | Full ROM, control the eccentric. |
| 5 | Standing Calf Raise | 3 | 12–15 | Per current working weight | Full ROM, 2s pause in stretch. Maintenance only. |
| 6 | Vacuum Practice | 3 holds | 20–30s each | — | Between sets or at end of session. Waist tightness for stage. |

**Session volume:** Quads 6 sets | Hamstrings 6 sets | Calves 3 sets

---

## Day 3 — Rest

- Hit daily step target
- Weeks 28–26: steps only (no LISS — you're already ramping frequency + starting a deficit)
- Week 26+: conditional LISS if fat loss is stalling (see Cardio section)
- Phase 2+: add 10–15 min posing practice

---

## Day 4 — Upper B: Shoulders + Arms

| # | Exercise | Working Sets | Rep Range | Starting Weight (Phase 1) | Notes |
|--:|----------|:------------:|:---------:|:-------------------------:|-------|
| — | Banded Shoulder Circle | 2 | — | Bodyweight (band) | Already in your routine. |
| — | Face Pull to External Rotation | 2 | 12–15 | 30–40 lb | Already in your routine. Warm-up / activation. |
| 1 | Lateral Raise (Cable) | 4 | 12–15 | 15–20 lb | **MP priority.** Slight lean-away for full ROM. Controlled. |
| 2 | Lateral Raise (Machine) | 3 | 15–20 | Per machine | Chase the burn. Partials on last set are fine. |
| 3 | Rear Delt Fly (Cable or Machine) | 3 | 15–20 | Start light, find MMC | Round out the rear cap. |
| 4 | Overhead Cable Triceps Extension | 3 | 12–15 | Per current working weight | Long head emphasis. Full stretch behind head. |
| 5 | EZ Bar Curl | 3 | 10–12 | Per current working weight | Strict form, no body English. |
| 6 | Incline Curl (Dumbbell) | 3 | 12–15 | 20–25 lb DBs | Deep stretch at bottom for long head. |
| 7 | Chest Dip (Assisted) | 3 | 10–12 | Per current assistance level | Already in your routine. Lean forward slightly for lower chest + tricep. |

**Session volume:** Lateral delts 7 sets | Rear delts 3 (+2 warm-up) | Triceps 6 sets | Biceps 6 sets

### Lateral Delt Ramp-Up (Weeks 28–25)

Your training history shows virtually no dedicated lateral raise volume. Going from ~0 to 7 sets on Day 4 alone is a big jump. For the first 3 weeks:
- Day 4: 3 sets cable + 2 sets machine = 5 sets (not full 7)
- Days 1 and 5: start with 2 sets each (not full 3)

By week 25, ramp to full prescribed volume across all three days.

---

## Day 5 — Upper C: Back + Rear Delts + Lateral Delts (Weak Point Day)

| # | Exercise | Working Sets | Rep Range | Starting Weight (Phase 1) | Notes |
|--:|----------|:------------:|:---------:|:-------------------------:|-------|
| — | Banded Shoulder Circle | 2 | — | Bodyweight (band) | Warm-up / activation. |
| ⭐ | Pull-Up (Bodyweight) | 3→2 | 8–12 → build to 15 | Bodyweight (172 lb) | You can do 8+ BW reps. Once you hit 15 clean reps across all sets, add weight (belt or DB between feet). |
| 2 | Lat Pulldown (Single Arm, Cable) | 3 | 10–12 | Per current working weight | You've been doing cable lat pulldowns recently. Full stretch at top, squeeze at bottom. |
| 3 | Machine Row (Neutral or Pronated Grip) | 3 | 8–12 | Heavy — find a challenging weight | **Back thickness.** Different movement pattern than Day 1 chest-supported rows. Heavier, more stable. Not sexy, not cinematic, works anyway. |
| 4 | Straight-Arm Pulldown (Cable) | 3 | 12–15 | 40–50 lb | Lat isolation. Mind-muscle connection. |
| 5 | Face Pull (Cable) | 3 | 15–20 | 40 lb | Rear delt + upper back detail. |
| 6 | Rear Delt Fly (Cable) | 3 | 15–20 | Start light | Finish rear delts for the week. |
| 7 | Lateral Raise (Cable or DB) | 3 | 15–20 | 15 lb | **Added.** End-of-workout pump sets. Delt volume distribution. |
| 8 | Hanging Leg Raise | 3 | 12–15 | Bodyweight | Abs. Controlled, no swinging. |
| 9 | Cable Crunch | 3 | 12–15 | Light | Focus on contraction, not loading. Avoid thickening obliques. |

> **Pull-up progression:** Double progression at bodyweight. Hold BW until you hit 15 reps across all sets → add 10 lb → reps drop to ~8–10 → build back up. You're past the assisted phase — this is a strength advantage.

**Session volume:** Back (lats/mid-back) 12 sets | Rear delts 6 sets | Lateral delts 3 sets | Abs 6 sets

---

## Day 6 — Rest

- Hit daily step target
- 15–20 min posing practice (priority day)

---

## Day 7 — Active Recovery

- **Posing:** 20–30 min (primary activity for this day)
- **Optional light pump session (15–20 min):** lateral raises, band pull-aparts, light curls. Nothing heavy. Vanity + blood flow, not training.
- Conditional LISS if scheduled

---

## Weekly Volume Audit (Corrected)

Volume now matches actual programming across all training days.

| Muscle Group | Sets/Week | Sources | Priority |
|-------------|:---------:|---------|:--------:|
| Back (lats + mid-back) | 21–24 | Day 1: 6 (CSR + incline row) / Day 5: 12 (pull-up, pulldown, machine row, straight-arm pulldown, face pull) + Day 1 face pulls | 🔴 #1 |
| Lateral Delts | 13–16 | Day 1: 3 / Day 4: 7 / Day 5: 3 / (+optional Day 7 pump) | 🔴 #1 |
| Rear Delts | 10–14 | Day 1: 3 (face pull) / Day 4: 3 (+2 warm-up) / Day 5: 6 (face pull + fly) | 🟠 High |
| Chest (upper bias) | 8–10 | Day 1: 8 (incline BB, incline DB, pec deck) | 🟡 Moderate |
| Biceps | 6–9 | Day 4: 6 (EZ curl + incline curl) + indirect from rowing | 🟡 Moderate |
| Triceps | 6–9 | Day 4: 6 (overhead ext + dips) + indirect from pressing | 🟡 Moderate |
| Abs | 6–9 | Day 5: 6 (hanging leg raise + cable crunch) + vacuum 3×/week | 🟡 Moderate |
| Quads | 6 | Day 2: 6 (squat + leg extension) | 🟢 Maintenance |
| Hamstrings/Glutes | 6 | Day 2: 6 (RDL + leg curl) | 🟢 Maintenance |
| Calves | 3 | Day 2: 3 (standing calf raise) | 🟢 Maintenance |

**Chest trade-off rationale:** Reduced from 9–12 → 8–10 sets/week by cutting incline DB press from 3→2 sets. Your bench is already strong (185×13). In MP, the marginal return from set #10 of chest is lower than set #14 of lateral delts. The volume went where judges look.

---

## Progression Rules by Phase

### Phase 1 (Weeks 28–16) — Build Habits, Push the Logbook

**Training:**
- Compounds (top set): Double progression at 5–8 reps. Hit 8 → add weight → reset to ~5.
- Compounds (back-offs): Double progression at 8–12 reps.
- Isolations: Double progression at 12–20 reps.
- Stall breakers: rest-pause (rack 10s, finish reps) or partial reps in safe ROM.

**Transition from your old progression style:** Your previous program used percentage-based programming with AMRAP test weeks (e.g., 3×8 at 80%, working up to AMRAP at 90%). The new approach is simpler — double progression with RPE awareness. No percentages. Push the reps, add weight when you hit the top of the range, log RPE on top sets.

**Habits to establish in this phase:**
- Daily step tracking (baseline week, then target)
- Daily weigh-in (7-day rolling average — weekly is too slow to catch drift)
- Structured meal prep replacing the untracked cheat meal
- Posing practice 2×/week (filmed)
- Waist measurement 2–3×/week (same conditions)
- **Log RPE on top sets in Strong**
- **Log assistance weight on assisted exercises consistently**

### Phase 2 (Weeks 15–8) — Hold the Line

**Training:**
- Drop to 2 working sets on compounds (1 top + 1 back-off).
- "Wins" = maintaining the same weight/reps, cleaner form, lower RPE at the same load, or stable performance while bodyweight drops.
- If strength drops >10% on a lift for 2+ consecutive weeks, flag it immediately.

**Benchmark targets to hold:**

| Lift | Phase 2 "Hold" Target | Red Flag Threshold |
|------|:---------------------:|:------------------:|
| Incline Bench (top set) | 155+ × 5–8 | Below 140 × 5 |
| Barbell Squat (top set) | 245+ × 5–8 | Below 225 × 5 |
| Pull-Up (BW or weighted) | 8+ reps at current load | Below 6 reps at BW |
| Chest-Supported Row | 45+ lb DBs × 8–12 | Below 40 lb × 8 |

**Mindset:** You are preserving muscle. The deficit does the fat loss work. Don't chase PRs. Don't panic. Your strength base is solid — the goal is to arrive on stage still moving respectable weight.

### Phase 3 (Weeks 7–0) — Arrive Stage-Lean This Time

**Training:**
- Keep 2 working sets unless fatigue/joints demand dropping to 1 top set in the final 3–4 weeks.
- Rep ranges drift to 8–15 naturally as load decreases.
- Maintain the same exercises and movement patterns. Don't overhaul the program because you're tired.

## Deload Schedule

| Deload | Weeks Out | Date | Protocol |
|:------:|:---------:|------|----------|
| 1 | 22 | Apr 4, 2026 | Volume -40%, keep intensity. No sets to failure. |
| 2 | 17 | May 9, 2026 | Volume -40%, keep intensity. |
| 3 | 12 | Jun 13, 2026 | Volume -30%. Assess joints, sleep, mood. Mid-prep checkpoint. |
| 4 | 8 | Jul 11, 2026 | Volume -30%. Deep deficit — this deload matters. |
| 5 | 4 | Aug 8, 2026 | Volume -30–40%. Transition toward peak week. |

**Auto-regulation override:** If you feel destroyed for 5+ consecutive days (sleep tanking, lifts cratering, mood wrecked, getting sick), take a deload regardless of schedule. Getting sick at 4 weeks out last time was your body telling you it was done. Listen this time.

**Deloads happen even when you "feel fine."** Humans love "earning" deloads. Your body doesn't care about your feelings. The scheduled deloads are non-negotiable recovery points.

---

## Nutrition Plan

### The Cheat Meal Problem

Your weekly family cheat meal at ~1,500 kcal is currently unmanaged. At a 500 kcal/day deficit, one 1,500 kcal meal wipes out roughly 2–3 days of progress.

**The fix is not "eliminate family dinners."** The fix is:

- **Phase 1:** Reframe as structured refeed. Higher carbs, keep protein high, fat moderate. Track it approximately. Budget by keeping the rest of that day slightly lower.
- **Phase 2:** Tighten. Meal still happens but within a calorie ceiling (~800–1,000 kcal over rest day target, mostly carbs).
- **Phase 3:** It becomes your planned refeed and nothing more. This is the sacrifice phase.

**Non-negotiable:** At no point does this meal go untracked. "I'll just eat clean the rest of the week" is how you showed up 4 weeks behind last time.

### Macro Principles

- Protein stays high throughout. Never cut protein to create the deficit.
- Fats have a floor (~40g minimum). Hormones, joints, brain function.
- Carbs are the primary lever for performance and deficit adjustments.
- All decisions based on **7-day rolling average weight + waist trend + training performance**.

### Phase 1 — Weeks 28–16

| Day Type | Calories | Protein | Fat | Carbs |
|----------|:--------:|:-------:|:---:|:-----:|
| Training (4–5 days) | 2,500 | 180g | 55g | ~320g |
| Rest (2–3 days) | 2,200 | 180g | 65g | ~225g |

> **Weekly average: ~2,370 kcal/day.** The first 14 days are a calibration phase. Without steps or cardio history, your TDEE is a guess until the scale confirms it. Run this for 14–21 days, track daily weight, and let the 7-day average tell you what's real.

### Phase 2 — Weeks 15–8

| Day Type | Calories | Protein | Fat | Carbs |
|----------|:--------:|:-------:|:---:|:-----:|
| Training | 2,350 | 185g | 50–55g | ~270g |
| Rest | 2,050 | 185g | 60–65g | ~170g |

### Phase 3 — Weeks 7–0

| Day Type | Calories | Protein | Fat | Carbs |
|----------|:--------:|:-------:|:---:|:-----:|
| Training | 2,200 | 190g | 45–50g | ~240g |
| Rest | 1,900 | 190g | 55–60g | ~120g |

### Carb Timing

- **Pre-workout (60–90 min before):** 40–80g carbs + 30–50g protein, low fat
- **Post-workout (across 4–6 hours):** 60–120g carbs spread across meals
- Keep most fats away from pre/post windows

### Adjustment Rules

| Scenario | Trigger | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Losing too fast | >1.25 lb/week for 2 weeks + performance tanking | +100–150 kcal/day (add carbs) |
| Loss stalled | <0.6 lb/week for 2 weeks, adherence confirmed | -150 kcal/day (cut carbs) OR add ~2,000 steps/day |
| Single bad weigh-in | Weight up 2 lbs one morning | Do nothing. Check the 7-day average. |
| Strength cratering | >10% drop for 2+ weeks (use benchmark table) | Assess sleep first → then consider +100 kcal or deload |
| Cheat meal blowout | Went 2,000+ kcal over | Don't compensate next day. Log it, move on, tighten next week. |

### Refeeds and Diet Breaks

- **Phase 1–2:** One structured refeed every 10–14 days (or align with family meal). Bring calories to approximately maintenance via carbs. Keep fat low.
- **Mid-prep diet break (optional):** 7–10 days at maintenance around weeks 14–12 if you're mentally cooked or performance has cratered. Not mandatory, but it can save a prep.
- **Phase 3:** Refeeds become strategic, tied to look assessment, not scheduled.

### Supplements

| Supplement | Dose | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| Creatine monohydrate | 5g/day | Continue through prep. Cell volumization > any water weight concern. |
| Caffeine | 200–400mg pre-workout | Use strategically. Don't escalate weekly. Cutoff: no later than 2 PM. |
| Fiber | 25–35g/day | From whole foods. Helps satiety as calories drop. |
| Electrolytes | Consistent daily | Sodium, potassium, magnesium. Don't randomly change intake. |
| Multivitamin | 1/day | Insurance policy when food variety decreases deep in prep. |

---

## Cardio and Steps Protocol

### Steps — Your First and Most Important Lever

You are currently not tracking steps. This changes immediately.

| Phase | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Week 28 (now) | Track steps for 7 days without changing behavior. Establish your natural baseline. |
| Week 27 onward | Set target 2,000 steps above your baseline (e.g., if baseline is 6,000 → target 8,000). |
| When fat loss stalls | Add 1,000–2,000 steps/day before adding formal cardio sessions. |

### LISS Cardio (Conditional — Not Automatic)

**Weeks 28–26: No formal LISS.** You are already stacking two new stressors (frequency ramp from ~3.75→5 days/week + caloric deficit). Adding cardio on top of that is the "three stressors at once" pattern that gets people sick. Steps + diet only.

**Week 26 onward:** Add LISS only when triggered by stall rules.

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Fat loss stalling (<0.6 lb/week for 2 weeks) + steps already at target | Add 2×20 min LISS (incline treadmill walk, 120–130 bpm) |
| Still stalling after 2 more weeks | Add a 3rd LISS session OR extend to 25–30 min |
| Phase 2 if loss pace needs support | Up to 3–4×25–30 min LISS |
| Phase 3 if needed | Up to 4–5×30–40 min LISS |

**Escalation order (always in this sequence):**
1. Steps (cheapest, lowest fatigue)
2. Calorie adjustment (-150 kcal, cut carbs)
3. LISS duration (extend existing sessions)
4. LISS frequency (add sessions)
5. Never add all at once

### Illness Prevention (You Got Sick Last Time)

- Never combine a calorie cut AND a cardio increase AND a volume increase in the same week
- Only change one variable at a time
- If you start feeling run down (sore throat, unusual fatigue, brain fog), take an immediate deload and add 200 kcal/day for 3–5 days. Losing 3 days of deficit is better than losing 2 weeks to illness.

## Posing Plan — Men's Physique Specific

### MP Mandatory Poses and Judging

Men's Physique uses **quarter turns**, not the mandatory bodybuilding poses. You will be judged on:

1. **Front pose** — relaxed but engaged. Shoulders slightly forward, abs tight, one arm slightly bent. V-taper, delt caps, abs, overall flow.
2. **Side turns (both)** — chest up, near arm relaxed or hand on hip, slight twist. Shoulder-to-waist ratio, posture, confidence.
3. **Back pose** — relaxed but lats slightly flared, shoulders wide, waist tight. Rear delt detail, lat width, taper.

You also need a confident stage walk, smooth transitions between quarter turns, and natural facial expression.

### Posing Schedule

| Phase | Frequency | Duration | Focus |
|-------|:---------:|:--------:|-------|
| Weeks 28–16 | 2×/week | 10–15 min | Learn the quarter turns. Front + back only. Hold 15–20s each. **Film every session.** |
| Weeks 16–8 | 3–4×/week | 15–20 min | Add side turns. Transitions. Stage walk. Compare to progress photos. |
| Weeks 8–4 | 5×/week | 20 min | Full mock prejudging rounds. Practice under fatigue (post-cardio). Refine facial expression and arm positioning. |
| Weeks 4–0 | Daily | 20–30 min | Full routine with timing. Practice in board shorts. Film from multiple angles. |

### Vacuum Practice

Vacuums are trained 3×/week as part of your leg day and active recovery. Start with 3 holds of 15–20 seconds, build to 30–60 second holds. A tight vacuum during front and side poses is a massive visual advantage in MP.

---

## Sleep and Recovery

- **Sleep target:** 7–8 hours per night. This is a requirement.
- **If sleep drops below 6 hours for 3+ consecutive nights:**
  1. Reduce caffeine and move cutoff to noon
  2. Reduce evening cardio if applicable
  3. Consider a mini-deload or temporary calorie bump before cutting harder
- **Job search stress:** You're prepping while actively interviewing. When interview stress peaks, the training plan bends — you don't add more volume or cardio to "make up for" a stressful week. Stress is cumulative. Your body doesn't separate work cortisol from training cortisol.
- **Water intake:** 0.5–0.75 oz per lb bodyweight (~86–129 oz/day). Consistent daily. Don't change intake dramatically day to day.

---

## Peak Week (To Be Programmed at Week 6 — Jul 25, 2026)

Peak week details will be added when:

- You are visibly lean enough that manipulation will make a difference
- You have stable data on how your body handles carbs, sodium, and water

**Principles decided now (specifics decided later):**

- Keep water and sodium consistent. Do not dehydrate. Dehydrated natural competitors look flat and worse, not better.
- Small carb manipulation based on visual assessment (mirror, not scale)
- Avoid extreme depletion workouts
- Final training: light pump session 1–2 days before stage
- Practice board short fit, tanning, and backstage logistics before show day
- Peak week goal: look 5% better. Not a coin flip between 20% better and 20% worse.

## NPC vs. Natural Federation Decision (Deadline: Apr 18, 2026)

| Factor | NPC | Natural (WNBF, OCB, NANBF, etc.) |
|--------|-----|-----------------------------------|
| Drug testing | Polygraph only (if tested at all) | Urinalysis + polygraph. Some require 7-year natural history. |
| Competition | Larger fields, more competitors | Smaller fields, more even playing field |
| Stage conditioning | Judges may expect harder conditioning | More reasonable conditioning expectations |
| Creatine | Allowed | Allowed in most federations (verify) |
| Show availability | More frequent, more locations | Fewer shows, may require travel |

> If you are lifetime natural and your goal is fair competition, a tested natural federation is likely the better experience.

## Monitoring Protocol

### Daily (every day, no exceptions)

- [ ] Weigh-in (fasted, morning, after bathroom, before food/water)
- [ ] Log food (including the family meal — approximate is fine, omission is not)
- [ ] Track steps

### 2–3× per Week

- [ ] Waist measurement (at navel, fasted, morning, same conditions)

### Weekly (same day, same conditions)

- [ ] Calculate 7-day average weight (trend direction and rate of loss)
- [ ] Top set performance on tracked compounds (incline bench, squat, pull-up)
- [ ] Sleep quality (hours + subjective 1–10)
- [ ] Hunger and energy (subjective 1–10)
- [ ] Step average for the week
- [ ] Progress photos: front relaxed, front flexed (MP front pose), side, back relaxed, back lats flared — same lighting, same time, same location
- [ ] Posing practice completed (yes/no + duration)
- [ ] Cheat meal / refeed tracked (yes/no + approximate kcal)

> **Red flag rule:** If 3 or more indicators are trending negatively for 2 consecutive weeks, something needs to change. Adjust one variable (calories, steps, cardio, or volume) — not all of them at once.

---

## Strong App Logging Standards

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Assisted dips logged with 0 or inconsistent weight | Always log the **assistance weight** the machine is set to. |
| No RPE logged | Add RPE to at least your **top set on compounds** each session. Use the notes field. |
| Inconsistent week-to-week tonnage | The structured program normalizes this. Flag any week >30% deviation from prior. |

## Starting Weight Quick Reference Card

**Phase 1 top-set starting points (conservative — room to progress):**

| Exercise | Starting Weight | Progression Target by Week 16 |

## Week 28 Execution Checklist (Feb 21–Feb 27, 2026)

Do this. Don't philosophize.

- [ ] Train 4 days (Days 1, 2, 4, 5)
- [ ] Track steps every day without changing behavior (establish baseline)
- [ ] Track food every day, including the family meal (approximate is fine, omission is not)
- [ ] Weigh in daily (fasted, morning)
- [ ] Start posing 2×10 minutes (front + back quarter turns only, filmed)
- [ ] Add Strong logging upgrades: top set RPE + assistance machine settings on dips
- [ ] Waist measurement 2× this week (fasted, morning, at navel)

## What's Different This Time

| Last Prep | This Prep |
|-----------|-----------|
| No step tracking | Daily step target from Week 1 |
| No structured cardio | Conditional LISS — only added when stall rules trigger, not automatically |
| Untracked weekly cheat meal | Structured refeed, accounted for in weekly calories |
| No posing practice | 2×/week from Day 1, filmed, daily by Week 8 |
| Got sick at 4 weeks out | Illness prevention: never stack 3 stressors, single-variable adjustments only |
| Showed up 4 weeks behind | Daily weigh-ins + 7-day rolling average + early warning triggers |
| Weekly weigh-ins (too slow) | Daily weigh-ins with rolling average + waist 2–3×/week |
| Training not competition-specific | MP-biased volume: delts and back prioritized, legs maintained |
| General hypertrophy split (chest/bicep days) | V-taper focused split with weak point days |
| %-based progression with AMRAP tests | Simple double progression with RPE tracking |
| Inconsistent volume week-to-week | Structured volume with 5 scheduled non-negotiable deloads |
| ~3.75 days/week frequency | 5 days/week with graduated frequency ramp |
| No lateral delt emphasis | 13–16 sets/week across 3 training days |
| Chest over-allocated for MP | Chest reduced to 8–10 sets, volume redistributed to delts |
| Assisted pull-ups only | Bodyweight → weighted pull-up progression |
| Stage weight guessed pessimistically (142–148) | Corrected to 148–151 based on LBM math |
| Vague timeline | Every milestone dated through Sep 5, 2026 |
