## Lessons From the Last Prep

You showed up 4 weeks too soft. That means one or more of the following happened:

1. The deficit started too late or too shallow
2. Adherence slipped in ways that weren't accounted for (the weekly cheat meal alone can erase 2–3 days of deficit)
3. No cardio or step tracking meant you had no secondary lever when fat loss stalled
4. Getting sick at ~4 weeks out suggests you were under-recovered, under-nourished, or both — possibly from a panic-cut in the final stretch

**This plan is built to prevent all four of those problems.**

---

## Target Physique

**Division emphasis (what judges score):** V-taper (wide shoulders → narrow waist), lateral and rear delt fullness, upper chest, lat width, tight midsection, stage presence and flow.

**What judges don't see:** Quads, hamstrings, calves (board shorts cover them). You still train legs for health and proportionality, but they are not a priority.

**Conditioning target:** 8–10% body fat. Not the striated-glutes condition of classic bodybuilding. You want lean, dry, full — not emaciated.

**Realistic stage weight:** 142–148 lbs depending on lean mass retention. That's 24–30 lbs of fat loss over 28 weeks (~0.9 lb/week average).

---

## Phase Overview

| Phase | Weeks Out | Focus | Training Volume (Compounds) | Compound Reps | Deficit |
|-------|-----------|-------|-----------------------------|---------------|---------|
| 1 — Foundation | 28–16 | Build habits, start fat loss, push strength | 3 working sets (1 top + 2 back-off) | Top: 5–8 / Back-off: 8–12 | Small to moderate |
| 2 — Mid-Prep | 15–8 | Hold muscle, deepen deficit, refine posing | 2 working sets (1 top + 1 back-off) | 6–10 / 8–12 | Moderate |
| 3 — Final Push | 7–0 | Get stage-lean, peak, present | 2 working sets (1 top set only in final 3–4 wks if needed) | 8–15 | Aggressive but controlled |

---

## Weekly Split

**5 training days. Upper body biased. One leg day (sufficient for MP).**

| Day | Session | Purpose |
|-----|---------|---------|
| 1 | Upper A — Chest + Back (Heavy) | Primary pressing + heavy rowing |
| 2 | Lower — Full Leg Day | Squat + hinge + maintenance volume |
| 3 | Rest | Steps + LISS (if scheduled) |
| 4 | Upper B — Shoulders + Arms | Delt priority + arm work |
| 5 | Upper C — Back + Rear Delts | Weak point blitz: lat width + mid-back thickness |
| 6 | Rest | Steps + posing |
| 7 | Active Recovery | Posing + optional light pump work |

---

## Day 1 — Upper A: Chest + Back (Heavy)

| # | Exercise | Working Sets | Rep Range | Notes |
|--:|----------|:------------:|:---------:|-------|
| ⭐ | Incline Bench Press (Barbell) | 3→2 | 5–8 / 8–12 | Progressive overload. Upper chest is an MP priority. |
| 2 | Chest-Supported Row | 3 | 8–12 | **Weak point.** Squeeze scapulae hard, 2s hold at contraction. Elbows wide for mid-back. |
| 3 | Incline Bench Press (Dumbbell) | 3 | 8–12 | Full stretch at bottom, moderate weight. |
| 4 | Incline Dumbbell Row | 3 | 8–12 | Pronated grip, drive elbows wide. Mid-back thickness. |
| 5 | Pec Deck (Machine) | 3 | 12–15 | Deep stretch, controlled squeeze. |
| 6 | Face Pull (Cable) | 3 | 15–20 | Rear delt + external rotation health. |

**Session volume:** Chest 9 sets | Back 9 sets | Rear delts 3 sets

---

## Day 2 — Lower: Full Leg Day

| # | Exercise | Working Sets | Rep Range | Notes |
|--:|----------|:------------:|:---------:|-------|
| ⭐ | Barbell Squat | 3→2 | 5–8 / 8–12 | Progressive overload. Technical failure only. |
| 2 | Romanian Deadlift (Barbell) | 3 | 8–12 | Hamstring-glute tie-in. Stop before back rounds. |
| 3 | Leg Extension (Machine) | 3 | 12–15 | Squeeze at top. |
| 4 | Lying Leg Curl (Machine) | 3 | 12–15 | Full ROM, control the eccentric. |
| 5 | Standing Calf Raise | 3 | 12–15 | Full ROM, 2s pause in stretch. Maintenance only. |
| 6 | Vacuum Practice | 3 holds | 20–30s each | Between sets or at end of session. Waist tightness for stage. |

> **Why only one leg day:** Board shorts cover everything below mid-thigh. You train legs enough to stay healthy, support metabolism, and maintain proportion. You don't need to build them for MP judging. The volume that would go to a second leg day is redistributed to shoulders and back.

**Session volume:** Quads 6 sets | Hamstrings 6 sets | Calves 3 sets

---

## Day 3 — Rest

- Hit daily step target
- LISS if scheduled (see Cardio section)
- Phase 2+: 10–15 min posing practice

---

## Day 4 — Upper B: Shoulders + Arms

| # | Exercise | Working Sets | Rep Range | Notes |
|--:|----------|:------------:|:---------:|-------|
| — | Banded Shoulder Circle | 2 | — | Warm-up / activation |
| — | Face Pull to External Rotation | 2 | 12–15 | Warm-up / activation |
| 1 | Lateral Raise (Cable) | 4 | 12–15 | **MP priority.** Slight lean-away for full ROM. Controlled. |
| 2 | Lateral Raise (Machine) | 3 | 15–20 | Chase the burn. Partials on last set are fine. |
| 3 | Rear Delt Fly (Cable or Machine) | 3 | 15–20 | Round out the rear cap. |
| 4 | Overhead Cable Triceps Extension | 3 | 12–15 | Long head emphasis. Full stretch behind head. |
| 5 | EZ Bar Curl | 3 | 10–12 | Strict form, no body English. |
| 6 | Incline Curl (Dumbbell) | 3 | 12–15 | Deep stretch at bottom for long head. |
| 7 | Chest Dip (Assisted) | 3 | 10–12 | Lower chest + tricep. Lean forward slightly. |

**Session volume:** Lateral delts 7 sets | Rear delts 3 (+2 warm-up) | Triceps 6 sets | Biceps 6 sets

---

## Day 5 — Upper C: Back + Rear Delts (Weak Point Day)

| # | Exercise | Working Sets | Rep Range | Notes |
|--:|----------|:------------:|:---------:|-------|
| — | Banded Shoulder Circle | 2 | — | Warm-up / activation |
| ⭐ | Pull-Up (Assisted) | 3→2 | 5–8 → build to 15 | Progressive overload via reducing assistance. Wide grip, full ROM. |
| 2 | Lat Pulldown (Single Arm) | 3 | 10–12 | Full stretch at top, squeeze at bottom. Lat width. |
| 3 | Chest-Supported Row (or Machine Row) | 3 | 8–12 | Mid-back thickness. Different grip or angle than Day 1. |
| 4 | Straight-Arm Pulldown (Cable) | 3 | 12–15 | Lat isolation. Mind-muscle connection. |
| 5 | Face Pull (Cable) | 3 | 15–20 | Rear delt + upper back detail. |
| 6 | Rear Delt Fly (Cable) | 3 | 15–20 | Finish rear delts for the week. |
| 7 | Hanging Leg Raise | 3 | 12–15 | Abs. Controlled, no swinging. |
| 8 | Cable Crunch | 3 | 12–15 | Light weight, focus on contraction, not loading. Avoid thickening obliques. |

> **Pull-up progression:** Same double progression logic. Keep the same assistance level until you hit 15 reps → reduce assistance → reps drop to ~8–10 → build back up. Once you reach bodyweight pull-ups for 10+ reps, switch to weighted pull-ups.

**Session volume:** Back (lats/mid-back) 12 sets | Rear delts 6 sets | Abs 6 sets

---

## Day 6 — Rest

- Hit daily step target
- 15–20 min posing practice (priority day)

---

## Day 7 — Active Recovery

- **Posing:** 20–30 min (primary activity for this day)
- **Optional light pump session (15–20 min):** lateral raises, band pull-aparts, light curls. Nothing heavy. This is vanity + blood flow, not training.
- LISS if scheduled

---

## Weekly Volume Audit

**MP-biased volume allocation. Upper body is the show.**

| Muscle Group | Sets/Week | Priority | Why |
|-------------|:---------:|:--------:|-----|
| Back (lats + mid-back) | 21–24 | 🔴 #1 priority | Lat width and mid-back thickness create the V-taper. Identified weak point. |
| Lateral Delts | 14–16 | 🔴 #1 priority | Shoulder width is the top of the V. Identified weak point. |
| Rear Delts | 10–14 | 🟠 High | Visible in back pose and side turns. Completes 3D delt look. |
| Chest (upper bias) | 9–12 | 🟡 Moderate | Upper chest fullness matters for front pose. Maintained, not prioritized. |
| Biceps | 6–9 | 🟡 Moderate | Visible in front and side poses. Adequate from curls + rowing. |
| Triceps | 6–9 | 🟡 Moderate | Visible in side turn. Adequate from pressing + direct work. |
| Abs | 6–9 | 🟡 Moderate | Centerpiece of front pose. Train for tightness, not thickness. |
| Quads | 6–9 | 🟢 Maintenance | Not visible on stage. Trained for health and proportion. |
| Hamstrings/Glutes | 6–9 | 🟢 Maintenance | Not visible on stage. Trained for health and posterior chain function. |
| Calves | 3 | 🟢 Maintenance | Not visible on stage. Minimal investment. |

## Progression Rules by Phase

### Phase 1 (Weeks 28–16) — Build Habits, Push the Logbook

**Training:**
- Compounds (top set): Double progression at 5–8 reps. Hit 8 → add weight → reset to ~5.
- Compounds (back-offs): Double progression at 8–12 reps.
- Isolations: Double progression at 12–20 reps.
- Stall breakers: rest-pause (rack 10s, finish reps) or partial reps in safe ROM.

**Habits to establish in this phase (you weren't doing these before):**
- Daily step tracking (start measuring, then set a target)
- Structured meal prep replacing the untracked cheat meal
- Posing practice 2x/week
- Weekly check-ins (weight, waist, photos)

### Phase 2 (Weeks 15–8) — Hold the Line

**Training:**
- Drop to 2 working sets on compounds (1 top + 1 back-off).
- "Wins" = maintaining the same weight/reps, cleaner form, lower RPE at the same load, or stable performance while bodyweight drops.
- If strength drops >10% on a lift for 2+ consecutive weeks, flag it immediately.

**Mindset:** You are preserving muscle. The deficit does the fat loss work. Don't chase PRs. Don't panic.

### Phase 3 (Weeks 7–0) — Arrive Stage-Lean This Time

**Training:**
- Keep 2 working sets unless fatigue/joints demand dropping to 1 top set in the final 3–4 weeks.
- Rep ranges drift to 8–15 naturally as load decreases.
- Maintain the same exercises and movement patterns. Don't overhaul the program because you're tired.

**Critical difference from last prep:** You will NOT be 4 weeks out and realize you're behind. The weekly check-ins, step tracking, and phased cardio ensure you're on track continuously. If you're behind at week 12, you adjust at week 12 — not by panic-cutting at week 4 and getting sick.

---

## Deload Schedule

| Deload | Week | Protocol |
|:------:|:----:|----------|
| 1 | 22 | Volume -40%, keep intensity. No sets to failure. |
| 2 | 17 | Volume -40%, keep intensity. |
| 3 | 12 | Volume -30%. Assess joints, sleep, mood. Mid-prep checkpoint. |
| 4 | 8 | Volume -30%. Deep deficit — this deload matters. |
| 5 | 4 | Volume -30–40%. Transition toward peak week. |

**Auto-regulation override:** If you feel destroyed for 5+ consecutive days (sleep tanking, lifts cratering, mood wrecked, getting sick), take a deload regardless of schedule. Getting sick at 4 weeks out last time was your body telling you it was done. Listen this time.

---

## Nutrition Plan

### The Cheat Meal Problem

Your weekly family cheat meal at ~1,500 kcal is currently unmanaged. At a 500 kcal/day deficit, one 1,500 kcal meal wipes out roughly 2–3 days of progress depending on how it lands.

**The fix is not "eliminate family dinners."** The fix is:

- **Phase 1:** Reframe it as a structured refeed. Eat higher carbs, keep protein high, keep fat moderate. Enjoy the meal but track it approximately. Budget for it by keeping the rest of that day slightly lower.
- **Phase 2:** Tighten it. The meal still happens but within a calorie ceiling (~800–1,000 kcal over your rest day target, mostly carbs).
- **Phase 3:** It becomes your planned refeed and nothing more. Or you shift it to a meal that fits your macros. This is the sacrifice phase.

**Non-negotiable:** At no point does this meal go untracked. "I'll just eat clean the rest of the week" is how you showed up 4 weeks behind last time.

### Macro Principles

- Protein stays high throughout. Never cut protein to create the deficit.
- Fats have a floor (~40g minimum). Hormones, joints, and brain function need them.
- Carbs are the primary lever for performance and deficit adjustments.
- All decisions based on **7-day average weight + waist measurement + training performance**.

### Phase 1 — Weeks 28–16

| Day Type | Calories | Protein | Fat | Carbs |
|----------|:--------:|:-------:|:---:|:-----:|
| Training (4–5 days) | 2,500 | 180g | 55g | ~320g |
| Rest (2–3 days) | 2,200 | 180g | 65g | ~225g |

> **Weekly average: ~2,370 kcal/day.** Run this for 14–21 days before adjusting. If you're not losing ~0.7–1.0 lb/week on average, adjust down. If you're losing faster than 1.25 lb/week AND performance is tanking, adjust up.

### Phase 2 — Weeks 15–8

| Day Type | Calories | Protein | Fat | Carbs |
|----------|:--------:|:-------:|:---:|:-----:|
| Training | 2,350 | 185g | 50–55g | ~270g |
| Rest | 2,050 | 185g | 60–65g | ~170g |

### Phase 3 — Weeks 7–0

| Day Type | Calories | Protein | Fat | Carbs |
|----------|:--------:|:-------:|:---:|:-----:|
| Training | 2,200 | 190g | 45–50g | ~240g |
| Rest | 1,900 | 190g | 55–60g | ~120g |

### Carb Timing

- **Pre-workout (60–90 min before):** 40–80g carbs + 30–50g protein, low fat
- **Post-workout (across 4–6 hours):** 60–120g carbs spread across meals
- Keep most fats away from pre/post windows

### Adjustment Rules

| Scenario | Trigger | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Losing too fast | >1.25 lb/week for 2 weeks + performance tanking | +100–150 kcal/day (add carbs) |
| Loss stalled | <0.6 lb/week for 2 weeks, adherence confirmed | -150 kcal/day (cut carbs) OR add ~2,000 steps/day |
| Single bad weigh-in | Weight up 2 lbs one morning | Do nothing. Check the 7-day average. |
| Strength cratering | >10% drop for 2+ weeks | Assess sleep first → then consider +100 kcal or deload |
| Cheat meal blowout | Went 2,000+ kcal over | Don't compensate next day. Log it, move on, tighten next week. |

### Refeeds and Diet Breaks

- **Phase 1–2:** One structured refeed every 10–14 days (or align with family meal). Bring calories to approximately maintenance via carbs. Keep fat low.
- **Mid-prep diet break (optional):** 7–10 days at maintenance around weeks 14–12 if you're mentally cooked or performance has cratered. Not mandatory, but it can save a prep.
- **Phase 3:** Refeeds become strategic, tied to look assessment, not scheduled.

### Supplements

| Supplement | Dose | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| Creatine monohydrate | 5g/day | Continue through prep. Cell volumization > any water weight concern. |
| Caffeine | 200–400mg pre-workout | Use strategically. Don't escalate weekly. Cutoff: no later than 2 PM. |
| Fiber | 25–35g/day | From whole foods. Helps satiety as calories drop. |
| Electrolytes | Consistent daily | Sodium, potassium, magnesium. Don't randomly change intake. |
| Multivitamin | 1/day | Insurance policy when food variety decreases deep in prep. |

---

## Cardio and Steps Protocol

### Steps — Your First and Most Important Lever

You are currently not tracking steps. This changes immediately.

| Phase | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Week 28 (now) | Track steps for 7 days without changing behavior. Establish your natural baseline. |
| Week 27 onward | Set target 2,000 steps above your baseline (e.g., if baseline is 6,000 → target 8,000). |
| When fat loss stalls | Add 1,000–2,000 steps/day before adding formal cardio sessions. |

> Steps are the easiest, lowest-fatigue way to increase energy expenditure. Your body unconsciously reduces NEAT during a deficit. Tracking steps catches this before it becomes a problem.

### LISS Cardio

| Phase | Sessions/Week | Duration | Modality | HR Target |
|-------|:------------:|:--------:|----------|:---------:|
| Phase 1 (28–16) | 2–3 | 20 min | Incline treadmill walk | 120–130 bpm |
| Phase 2 (15–8) | 3–4 | 25–30 min | Incline walk or bike | 120–130 bpm |
| Phase 3 (7–0) | 4–5 | 30–40 min | Incline walk or bike | 120–130 bpm |

> **Rule:** Increase cardio only when fat loss stalls for 2 consecutive weeks AND step target is already being hit AND you've tried a small calorie adjustment first. Stack the levers in order: steps → calories → cardio duration → cardio frequency.

### Illness Prevention (You Got Sick Last Time)

Getting sick at ~4 weeks out likely meant your immune system was suppressed from the combined stress of deep deficit + high training volume + inadequate recovery. To prevent this:

- Never combine a calorie cut AND a cardio increase AND a volume increase in the same week
- Only change one variable at a time
- If you start feeling run down (sore throat, unusual fatigue, brain fog), take an immediate deload and add 200 kcal/day for 3–5 days. Losing 3 days of deficit is better than losing 2 weeks to illness.

## Posing Plan — Men's Physique Specific

### MP Mandatory Poses and Judging

Men's Physique uses **quarter turns**, not the mandatory bodybuilding poses. You will be judged on:

1. **Front pose** — relaxed but engaged. Shoulders slightly forward, abs tight, one arm slightly bent. V-taper, delt caps, abs, overall flow.
2. **Side turns (both)** — chest up, near arm relaxed or hand on hip, slight twist. Shoulder-to-waist ratio, posture, confidence.
3. **Back pose** — relaxed but lats slightly flared, shoulders wide, waist tight. Rear delt detail, lat width, taper.

**You also need:** a confident stage walk, smooth transitions between quarter turns, and natural facial expression (not grimacing like you're deadlifting).

### Posing Schedule

| Phase | Frequency | Duration | Focus |
|-------|:---------:|:--------:|-------|
| Weeks 28–16 | 2x/week | 10–15 min | Learn the quarter turns. Practice each pose individually. Hold 15–20s each. Film weekly. |
| Weeks 16–8 | 3–4x/week | 15–20 min | Transitions between poses. Stage walk practice. Compare to weekly progress photos. |
| Weeks 8–4 | 5x/week | 20 min | Full mock prejudging rounds. Practice under fatigue (post-cardio). Refine facial expression and arm positioning. |
| Weeks 4–0 | Daily | 20–30 min | Full routine with timing. Practice in board shorts you'll wear on stage. Film from multiple angles. |

### Vacuum Practice

Vacuums are trained 3x/week as part of your ab work. Start with 3 holds of 15–20 seconds, build to 30–60 second holds. A tight vacuum during front and side poses is a massive visual advantage in MP — it makes your waist look smaller and your shoulders look wider.

---

## Sleep and Recovery

- **Sleep target:** 7–8 hours per night. This is a requirement.
- **If sleep drops below 6 hours for 3+ consecutive nights:**
  1. Reduce caffeine and move cutoff to noon
  2. Reduce evening cardio if applicable
  3. Consider a mini-deload or temporary calorie bump before cutting harder
- **Job search stress:** You're prepping while actively interviewing. When interview stress peaks, the training plan bends — you don't add more volume or cardio to "make up for" a stressful week. Stress is cumulative. Your body doesn't separate work cortisol from training cortisol.
- **Water intake:** Consistent daily. 0.5–0.75 oz per lb bodyweight (~86–129 oz/day). Don't change water intake dramatically day to day.

---

## Peak Week (To Be Programmed at Week 6)

Peak week details will be added when:

- You are visibly lean enough that manipulation will make a difference
- You have stable data on how your body handles carbs, sodium, and water

**Principles decided now (specifics decided later):**

- Keep water and sodium consistent. Do not dehydrate. Dehydrated natural competitors look flat and worse, not better.
- Small carb manipulation based on visual assessment (mirror, not scale)
- Avoid extreme depletion workouts
- Final training: light pump session 1–2 days before stage
- Practice board short fit, tanning, and backstage logistics before show day
- Peak week goal: look 5% better. Not a coin flip between 20% better and 20% worse.

---

## NPC vs. Natural Federation Decision

This should be decided by Week 20 at the latest (registration deadlines, drug testing protocols, and show calendars vary).

| Factor | NPC | Natural (WNBF, OCB, NANBF, etc.) |
|--------|-----|-----------------------------------|
| Drug testing | Polygraph only (if tested at all) | Urinalysis + polygraph. Some require 7-year natural history. |
| Competition | Larger fields, more competitors | Smaller fields, more even playing field |
| Stage conditioning | Judges may expect harder conditioning | More reasonable conditioning expectations |
| Creatine | Allowed | Allowed in most federations (verify) |
| Show availability | More frequent, more locations | Fewer shows, may require travel |

> If you are lifetime natural and your goal is fair competition, a tested natural federation is likely the better experience. If you want the largest stage and don't mind potentially competing against enhanced athletes, NPC gives you more options.

---

## Weekly Check-In Protocol

Every 7 days (same day, same conditions), assess:

- [ ] 7-day average weight (trend direction and rate of loss)
- [ ] Waist measurement (at navel, fasted, morning)
- [ ] Top set performance on the 3 tracked compounds (squat, incline bench, pull-up)
- [ ] Sleep quality (hours + subjective 1–10)
- [ ] Hunger and energy (subjective 1–10)
- [ ] Step average for the week (are you hitting target?)
- [ ] Progress photos: front relaxed, front flexed (MP front pose), side, back relaxed, back lats flared — same lighting, same time, same location
- [ ] Posing practice completed (yes/no + duration)
- [ ] Cheat meal / refeed tracked (yes/no + approximate kcal)

> **Red flag rule:** If 3 or more indicators are trending negatively for 2 consecutive weeks, something needs to change. Adjust one variable (calories, steps, cardio, or volume) — not all of them at once.

---

## Week-by-Week Summary

| Day | Training | Cardio | Posing |
|-----|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Upper A — Chest + Back (Heavy) | — | — |
| 2 | Lower — Squat + Hinge + Accessories | — | — |
| 3 | Rest | Steps + LISS (if scheduled) | 10–15 min (Phase 2+) |
| 4 | Upper B — Shoulders + Arms | — | — |
| 5 | Upper C — Back + Rear Delts | Post-session LISS (if scheduled) | — |
| 6 | Rest | Steps | 15–20 min |
| 7 | Active Recovery | LISS (if scheduled) | 20–30 min (primary activity) |

---

## What's Different This Time

| Last Prep | This Prep |
|-----------|-----------|
| No step tracking | Daily step target from Week 1 |
| No structured cardio | Phased LISS with clear escalation rules |
| Untracked weekly cheat meal | Structured refeed, accounted for in weekly calories |
| No posing practice | 2x/week from Day 1, daily by Week 8 |
| Got sick at 4 weeks out | Deload schedule + illness prevention protocol + single-variable adjustments |
| Showed up 4 weeks behind | Weekly check-ins with early warning triggers at Week 12 |
| Training not competition-specific | MP-biased volume: delts and back prioritized, legs maintained |
