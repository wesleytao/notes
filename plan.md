## Current Strength Profile (from Strong export, last 84 days)

| Lift | Best Recent Set | Est. 1RM (Epley) | Date |
|------|----------------|:-----------------:|------|
| Barbell Squat | 275 × 13 | ~394 | Dec 7, 2025 |
| Barbell Bench Press | 185 × 13 | ~265 | Dec 29, 2025 |
| Incline Barbell Bench | 165 × 8 | ~209 | Feb 15, 2026 |
| Bodyweight Pull-Up | 8+ reps at BW | — | Current |
| Bent Over Barbell Row | 155 × 18 | ~248 | Dec 30, 2025 |

**Key observations:**
- Significantly stronger than the old prep data (bench was 155×5, squat was 225×8 during the last prep cycle)
- Already training many exercises from this plan: assisted pull-ups, chest-supported rows, face pulls, incline DB press, pec deck, cable triceps, chest dips, banded shoulder circles
- Upper body push and vertical pull are the current training emphasis — lateral delt and dedicated back-thickness work need to ramp up
- Lower body frequency is already deprioritized (aligns with MP approach)
- Frequency ramping from ~3.75 to 5 days/week is a meaningful jump — Phase 1 builds into this

---

## Lessons From the Last Prep

You showed up 4 weeks too soft. That means one or more of the following happened:

1. The deficit started too late or too shallow
2. Adherence slipped in ways that weren't accounted for (the weekly cheat meal alone can erase 2–3 days of deficit)
3. No cardio or step tracking meant you had no secondary lever when fat loss stalled
4. Getting sick at ~4 weeks out suggests you were under-recovered, under-nourished, or both — possibly from a panic-cut in the final stretch

**Your old training program also wasn't competition-specific.** It was general hypertrophy (chest/bicep splits, no delt or back emphasis, percentage-based progression with AMRAP test weeks). The exercises were fine but the volume allocation didn't target what MP judges score.

**This plan is built to prevent all of those problems.**

---

## Target Physique

**Division emphasis (what judges score):** V-taper (wide shoulders → narrow waist), lateral and rear delt fullness, upper chest, lat width, tight midsection, stage presence and flow.

**What judges don't see:** Quads, hamstrings, calves (board shorts cover them). You still train legs for health and proportionality, but they are not a priority.

**Conditioning target:** 8–10% body fat. Not the striated-glutes condition of classic bodybuilding. You want lean, dry, full — not emaciated.

**Realistic stage weight:** 142–148 lbs depending on lean mass retention. That's 24–30 lbs of fat loss over 28 weeks (~0.9 lb/week average). Given your strength base, aim to preserve as much of that as possible — coming in at the upper end (148) with full muscle is better than 142 and flat.

## Phase Overview

| Phase | Weeks Out | Focus | Training Volume (Compounds) | Compound Reps | Deficit |
|-------|-----------|-------|-----------------------------|---------------|---------|
| 1 — Foundation | 28–16 | Build habits, ramp frequency to 5 days, start fat loss, push strength | 3 working sets (1 top + 2 back-off) | Top: 5–8 / Back-off: 8–12 | Small to moderate |
| 2 — Mid-Prep | 15–8 | Hold muscle, deepen deficit, refine posing | 2 working sets (1 top + 1 back-off) | 6–10 / 8–12 | Moderate |
| 3 — Final Push | 7–0 | Get stage-lean, peak, present | 2 working sets (1 top set only in final 3–4 wks if needed) | 8–15 | Aggressive but controlled |

### Frequency Ramp (Weeks 28–24)

You're currently at ~3.75 training days/week. Jumping straight to 5 risks overreaching.

| Week | Training Days | Notes |
|------|:------------:|-------|
| 28 | 4 | Run Days 1, 2, 4, 5. Skip Day 7 active recovery. |
| 27 | 4–5 | Add Day 7 if recovery is solid. |
| 26 onward | 5 | Full split operational. |

---

## Weekly Split

**5 training days. Upper body biased. One leg day (sufficient for MP).**

| Day | Session | Purpose |
|-----|---------|---------|
| 1 | Upper A — Chest + Back (Heavy) | Primary pressing + heavy rowing |
| 2 | Lower — Full Leg Day | Squat + hinge + maintenance volume |
| 3 | Rest | Steps + LISS (if scheduled) |
| 4 | Upper B — Shoulders + Arms | Delt priority + arm work |
| 5 | Upper C — Back + Rear Delts | Weak point blitz: lat width + mid-back thickness |
| 6 | Rest | Steps + posing |
| 7 | Active Recovery | Posing + optional light pump work |

---

## Day 1 — Upper A: Chest + Back (Heavy)

| # | Exercise | Working Sets | Rep Range | Starting Weight (Phase 1) | Notes |
|--:|----------|:------------:|:---------:|:-------------------------:|-------|
| ⭐ | Incline Bench Press (Barbell) | 3→2 | 5–8 / 8–12 | Top: 155 lb / Back-off: 135 lb | Progressive overload. Upper chest is an MP priority. You recently hit 165×8 — start conservative at 155 to establish the rep scheme, then push. |
| 2 | Chest-Supported Row | 3 | 8–12 | 45 lb DBs (per hand) | **Weak point.** You did 4×12 at 45 lb on Feb 21 — good starting point. Squeeze scapulae hard, 2s hold at contraction. Elbows wide for mid-back. |
| 3 | Incline Bench Press (Dumbbell) | 3 | 8–12 | 55–60 lb DBs | You've been doing incline DB work recently (16 sets in last 28 days). Full stretch at bottom, moderate weight. |
| 4 | Incline Dumbbell Row | 3 | 8–12 | 40–45 lb DBs | Pronated grip, drive elbows wide. Mid-back thickness. New movement — start light and find the groove. |
| 5 | Pec Deck (Machine) | 3 | 12–15 | Per current working weight | Already in your rotation (9 sets in last 28 days). Deep stretch, controlled squeeze. |
| 6 | Face Pull (Cable) | 3 | 15–20 | 40 lb | You logged face pull to external rotation at 40 lb recently. Continue from there. |

**Session volume:** Chest 9 sets | Back 9 sets | Rear delts 3 sets

---

## Day 2 — Lower: Full Leg Day

| # | Exercise | Working Sets | Rep Range | Starting Weight (Phase 1) | Notes |
|--:|----------|:------------:|:---------:|:-------------------------:|-------|
| ⭐ | Barbell Squat | 3→2 | 5–8 / 8–12 | Top: 245 lb / Back-off: 225 lb | You hit 275×13 in December. Start at ~62% 1RM for back-off, ~72% for top set. Technical failure only. |
| 2 | Romanian Deadlift (Barbell) | 3 | 8–12 | 185 lb | Based on your deadlift history (345 1RM). Hamstring-glute tie-in. Stop before back rounds. |
| 3 | Leg Extension (Machine) | 3 | 12–15 | Per current working weight | Squeeze at top. |
| 4 | Lying Leg Curl (Machine) | 3 | 12–15 | Per current working weight | Full ROM, control the eccentric. |
| 5 | Standing Calf Raise | 3 | 12–15 | Per current working weight | Full ROM, 2s pause in stretch. Maintenance only. |
| 6 | Vacuum Practice | 3 holds | 20–30s each | — | Between sets or at end of session. Waist tightness for stage. |

> **Why only one leg day:** Board shorts cover everything below mid-thigh. You train legs enough to stay healthy, support metabolism, and maintain proportion. The volume that would go to a second leg day is redistributed to shoulders and back.

**Session volume:** Quads 6 sets | Hamstrings 6 sets | Calves 3 sets

---

## Day 3 — Rest

- Hit daily step target
- LISS if scheduled (see Cardio section)
- Phase 2+: 10–15 min posing practice

---

## Day 4 — Upper B: Shoulders + Arms

| # | Exercise | Working Sets | Rep Range | Starting Weight (Phase 1) | Notes |
|--:|----------|:------------:|:---------:|:-------------------------:|-------|
| — | Banded Shoulder Circle | 2 | — | Bodyweight (band) | Already in your routine. Keep it. |
| — | Face Pull to External Rotation | 2 | 12–15 | 30–40 lb | Already in your routine (8 sets in last 28 days). Warm-up / activation. |
| 1 | Lateral Raise (Cable) | 4 | 12–15 | Start at 15–20 lb | **MP priority.** This is a NEW emphasis for you — lateral delt volume has been low. Slight lean-away for full ROM. Controlled. |
| 2 | Lateral Raise (Machine) | 3 | 15–20 | Per machine | Chase the burn. Partials on last set are fine. |
| 3 | Rear Delt Fly (Cable or Machine) | 3 | 15–20 | Start light, find MMC | Round out the rear cap. |
| 4 | Overhead Cable Triceps Extension | 3 | 12–15 | Per current working weight | You've been doing cable triceps work (10 sets in last 28 days). Long head emphasis. Full stretch behind head. |
| 5 | EZ Bar Curl | 3 | 10–12 | Per current working weight | Strict form, no body English. |
| 6 | Incline Curl (Dumbbell) | 3 | 12–15 | 20–25 lb DBs | Deep stretch at bottom for long head. |
| 7 | Chest Dip (Assisted) | 3 | 10–12 | Per current assistance level | Already in your routine (9 sets in last 28 days). Lean forward slightly for lower chest + tricep. |

**Session volume:** Lateral delts 7 sets | Rear delts 3 (+2 warm-up) | Triceps 6 sets | Biceps 6 sets

### Note on Lateral Delt Ramp-Up

Your training history shows virtually no dedicated lateral raise volume. Going from ~0 to 7 sets/week is a big jump. For weeks 28–26, consider:
- 3 sets cable lateral raise + 2 sets machine lateral raise (5 total)
- Ramp to full 7 sets by week 25

This prevents shoulder joint irritation and lets you establish the mind-muscle connection first.

---

## Day 5 — Upper C: Back + Rear Delts (Weak Point Day)

| # | Exercise | Working Sets | Rep Range | Starting Weight (Phase 1) | Notes |
|--:|----------|:------------:|:---------:|:-------------------------:|-------|
| — | Banded Shoulder Circle | 2 | — | Bodyweight (band) | Warm-up / activation. |
| ⭐ | Pull-Up (Bodyweight) | 3→2 | 8–12 → build to 15 | Bodyweight (172 lb) | You can do 8+ BW reps — start here. Once you hit 15 clean reps, add weight (belt or DB between feet). |
| 2 | Lat Pulldown (Single Arm, Cable) | 3 | 10–12 | Per current working weight | You've been doing cable lat pulldowns (11 sets in last 28 days). Full stretch at top, squeeze at bottom. |
| 3 | Chest-Supported Row (or Machine Row) | 3 | 8–12 | 45–50 lb DBs | Mid-back thickness. Use a different grip or angle than Day 1 (e.g., neutral grip here if wide grip on Day 1). |
| 4 | Straight-Arm Pulldown (Cable) | 3 | 12–15 | 40–50 lb | Lat isolation. Mind-muscle connection. |
| 5 | Face Pull (Cable) | 3 | 15–20 | 40 lb | Rear delt + upper back detail. |
| 6 | Rear Delt Fly (Cable) | 3 | 15–20 | Start light | Finish rear delts for the week. |
| 7 | Hanging Leg Raise | 3 | 12–15 | Bodyweight | Abs. Controlled, no swinging. |
| 8 | Cable Crunch | 3 | 12–15 | Light | Focus on contraction, not loading. Avoid thickening obliques. |

> **Pull-up progression:** You're past the assisted phase. Use double progression: hold BW until you hit 15 reps across all sets → add 10 lb → reps drop to ~8–10 → build back up. This is a strength you have over the original plan's assumption.

**Session volume:** Back (lats/mid-back) 12 sets | Rear delts 6 sets | Abs 6 sets

---

## Day 6 — Rest

- Hit daily step target
- 15–20 min posing practice (priority day)

---

## Day 7 — Active Recovery

- **Posing:** 20–30 min (primary activity for this day)
- **Optional light pump session (15–20 min):** lateral raises, band pull-aparts, light curls. Nothing heavy. This is vanity + blood flow, not training.
- LISS if scheduled

---

## Weekly Volume Audit

| Muscle Group | Sets/Week | Priority | Why |
|-------------|:---------:|:--------:|-----|
| Back (lats + mid-back) | 21–24 | 🔴 #1 priority | Lat width and mid-back thickness create the V-taper. Identified weak point. Your bent-over row (155×18) and recent chest-supported row work are a good base to build from. |
| Lateral Delts | 14–16 | 🔴 #1 priority | Shoulder width is the top of the V. Identified weak point. **Currently under-trained** — this is the biggest volume change from your current programming. |
| Rear Delts | 10–14 | 🟠 High | Visible in back pose and side turns. Completes 3D delt look. Face pulls are already in your routine — adding dedicated fly work. |
| Chest (upper bias) | 9–12 | 🟡 Moderate | Upper chest fullness matters for front pose. Your bench is strong (185×13). Maintained, not prioritized. |
| Biceps | 6–9 | 🟡 Moderate | Visible in front and side poses. Adequate from curls + rowing. |
| Triceps | 6–9 | 🟡 Moderate | Visible in side turn. Already getting cable triceps work. Adequate from pressing + direct work. |
| Abs | 6–9 | 🟡 Moderate | Centerpiece of front pose. Train for tightness, not thickness. Your old program had an ab menu (pick 2 exercises per day) — this plan is more targeted. |
| Quads | 6–9 | 🟢 Maintenance | Not visible on stage. Your squat is strong (275×13) — maintain, don't build. |
| Hamstrings/Glutes | 6–9 | 🟢 Maintenance | Not visible on stage. Trained for health and posterior chain function. |
| Calves | 3 | 🟢 Maintenance | Not visible on stage. Minimal investment. |

## Progression Rules by Phase

### Phase 1 (Weeks 28–16) — Build Habits, Push the Logbook

**Training:**
- Compounds (top set): Double progression at 5–8 reps. Hit 8 → add weight → reset to ~5.
- Compounds (back-offs): Double progression at 8–12 reps.
- Isolations: Double progression at 12–20 reps.
- Stall breakers: rest-pause (rack 10s, finish reps) or partial reps in safe ROM.

**Transition from your old progression style:** Your previous program used percentage-based programming with AMRAP test weeks (e.g., 3×8 at 80%, working up to AMRAP at 90%). The new approach is simpler — double progression with RPE awareness. No need to calculate percentages. Just push the reps, add weight when you hit the top of the range, and log the RPE on top sets.

**Habits to establish in this phase (you weren't doing these before):**
- Daily step tracking (start measuring, then set a target)
- Structured meal prep replacing the untracked cheat meal
- Posing practice 2x/week
- Weekly check-ins (weight, waist, photos)
- **Logging RPE on top sets in Strong** (you have the infrastructure, just add this data point)
- **Logging assistance weight on assisted exercises** (your Strong data has gaps here — fix this for trackability)

### Phase 2 (Weeks 15–8) — Hold the Line

**Training:**
- Drop to 2 working sets on compounds (1 top + 1 back-off).
- "Wins" = maintaining the same weight/reps, cleaner form, lower RPE at the same load, or stable performance while bodyweight drops.
- If strength drops >10% on a lift for 2+ consecutive weeks, flag it immediately.

**Benchmark targets to hold (based on your current strength):**

| Lift | Phase 2 "Hold" Target | Red Flag Threshold |
|------|:---------------------:|:------------------:|
| Incline Bench (top set) | 155+ × 5–8 | Below 140 × 5 |
| Barbell Squat (top set) | 245+ × 5–8 | Below 225 × 5 |
| Pull-Up (BW or weighted) | 8+ reps at current load | Below 6 reps at BW |
| Chest-Supported Row | 45+ lb DBs × 8–12 | Below 40 lb × 8 |

**Mindset:** You are preserving muscle. The deficit does the fat loss work. Don't chase PRs. Don't panic. Your strength base is solid — the goal is to arrive on stage still moving respectable weight.

### Phase 3 (Weeks 7–0) — Arrive Stage-Lean This Time

**Training:**
- Keep 2 working sets unless fatigue/joints demand dropping to 1 top set in the final 3–4 weeks.
- Rep ranges drift to 8–15 naturally as load decreases.
- Maintain the same exercises and movement patterns. Don't overhaul the program because you're tired.

**Critical difference from last prep:** You will NOT be 4 weeks out and realize you're behind. The weekly check-ins, step tracking, and phased cardio ensure you're on track continuously. If you're behind at week 12, you adjust at week 12 — not by panic-cutting at week 4 and getting sick.

---

## Deload Schedule

| Deload | Week | Protocol |
|:------:|:----:|----------|
| 1 | 22 | Volume -40%, keep intensity. No sets to failure. |
| 2 | 17 | Volume -40%, keep intensity. |
| 3 | 12 | Volume -30%. Assess joints, sleep, mood. Mid-prep checkpoint. |
| 4 | 8 | Volume -30%. Deep deficit — this deload matters. |
| 5 | 4 | Volume -30–40%. Transition toward peak week. |

**Auto-regulation override:** If you feel destroyed for 5+ consecutive days (sleep tanking, lifts cratering, mood wrecked, getting sick), take a deload regardless of schedule. Getting sick at 4 weeks out last time was your body telling you it was done. Listen this time.

**Note on your training history:** Your old program included deloads but they were infrequent (one visible at W17 in the old log). Your volume has also been inconsistent week-to-week (tonnage ranged from 21k to 84k in recent weeks, with an anomalous 117k spike). The scheduled deloads here are non-negotiable recovery points, not optional.

---

## Nutrition Plan

### The Cheat Meal Problem

Your weekly family cheat meal at ~1,500 kcal is currently unmanaged. At a 500 kcal/day deficit, one 1,500 kcal meal wipes out roughly 2–3 days of progress depending on how it lands.

**The fix is not "eliminate family dinners."** The fix is:

- **Phase 1:** Reframe it as a structured refeed. Eat higher carbs, keep protein high, keep fat moderate. Enjoy the meal but track it approximately. Budget for it by keeping the rest of that day slightly lower.
- **Phase 2:** Tighten it. The meal still happens but within a calorie ceiling (~800–1,000 kcal over your rest day target, mostly carbs).
- **Phase 3:** It becomes your planned refeed and nothing more. Or you shift it to a meal that fits your macros. This is the sacrifice phase.

**Non-negotiable:** At no point does this meal go untracked. "I'll just eat clean the rest of the week" is how you showed up 4 weeks behind last time.

### Macro Principles

- Protein stays high throughout. Never cut protein to create the deficit.
- Fats have a floor (~40g minimum). Hormones, joints, and brain function need them.
- Carbs are the primary lever for performance and deficit adjustments.
- All decisions based on **7-day average weight + waist measurement + training performance**.

### Phase 1 — Weeks 28–16

| Day Type | Calories | Protein | Fat | Carbs |
|----------|:--------:|:-------:|:---:|:-----:|
| Training (4–5 days) | 2,500 | 180g | 55g | ~320g |
| Rest (2–3 days) | 2,200 | 180g | 65g | ~225g |

> **Weekly average: ~2,370 kcal/day.** Run this for 14–21 days before adjusting. If you're not losing ~0.7–1.0 lb/week on average, adjust down. If you're losing faster than 1.25 lb/week AND performance is tanking, adjust up.

> **Calibration note:** Given your current lack of cardio and step tracking, your actual TDEE may be lower than expected. Be honest with tracking for the first 2–3 weeks and let the scale tell you if this starting point is right.

### Phase 2 — Weeks 15–8

| Day Type | Calories | Protein | Fat | Carbs |
|----------|:--------:|:-------:|:---:|:-----:|
| Training | 2,350 | 185g | 50–55g | ~270g |
| Rest | 2,050 | 185g | 60–65g | ~170g |

### Phase 3 — Weeks 7–0

| Day Type | Calories | Protein | Fat | Carbs |
|----------|:--------:|:-------:|:---:|:-----:|
| Training | 2,200 | 190g | 45–50g | ~240g |
| Rest | 1,900 | 190g | 55–60g | ~120g |

### Carb Timing

- **Pre-workout (60–90 min before):** 40–80g carbs + 30–50g protein, low fat
- **Post-workout (across 4–6 hours):** 60–120g carbs spread across meals
- Keep most fats away from pre/post windows

### Adjustment Rules

| Scenario | Trigger | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Losing too fast | >1.25 lb/week for 2 weeks + performance tanking | +100–150 kcal/day (add carbs) |
| Loss stalled | <0.6 lb/week for 2 weeks, adherence confirmed | -150 kcal/day (cut carbs) OR add ~2,000 steps/day |
| Single bad weigh-in | Weight up 2 lbs one morning | Do nothing. Check the 7-day average. |
| Strength cratering | >10% drop for 2+ weeks (use benchmark table above) | Assess sleep first → then consider +100 kcal or deload |
| Cheat meal blowout | Went 2,000+ kcal over | Don't compensate next day. Log it, move on, tighten next week. |

### Refeeds and Diet Breaks

- **Phase 1–2:** One structured refeed every 10–14 days (or align with family meal). Bring calories to approximately maintenance via carbs. Keep fat low.
- **Mid-prep diet break (optional):** 7–10 days at maintenance around weeks 14–12 if you're mentally cooked or performance has cratered. Not mandatory, but it can save a prep.
- **Phase 3:** Refeeds become strategic, tied to look assessment, not scheduled.

### Supplements

| Supplement | Dose | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| Creatine monohydrate | 5g/day | Continue through prep. Cell volumization > any water weight concern. |
| Caffeine | 200–400mg pre-workout | Use strategically. Don't escalate weekly. Cutoff: no later than 2 PM. |
| Fiber | 25–35g/day | From whole foods. Helps satiety as calories drop. |
| Electrolytes | Consistent daily | Sodium, potassium, magnesium. Don't randomly change intake. |
| Multivitamin | 1/day | Insurance policy when food variety decreases deep in prep. |

---

## Cardio and Steps Protocol

### Steps — Your First and Most Important Lever

You are currently not tracking steps. This changes immediately.

| Phase | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Week 28 (now) | Track steps for 7 days without changing behavior. Establish your natural baseline. |
| Week 27 onward | Set target 2,000 steps above your baseline (e.g., if baseline is 6,000 → target 8,000). |
| When fat loss stalls | Add 1,000–2,000 steps/day before adding formal cardio sessions. |

> Steps are the easiest, lowest-fatigue way to increase energy expenditure. Your body unconsciously reduces NEAT during a deficit. Tracking steps catches this before it becomes a problem.

### LISS Cardio

| Phase | Sessions/Week | Duration | Modality | HR Target |
|-------|:------------:|:--------:|----------|:---------:|
| Phase 1 (28–16) | 2–3 | 20 min | Incline treadmill walk | 120–130 bpm |
| Phase 2 (15–8) | 3–4 | 25–30 min | Incline walk or bike | 120–130 bpm |
| Phase 3 (7–0) | 4–5 | 30–40 min | Incline walk or bike | 120–130 bpm |

> **Rule:** Increase cardio only when fat loss stalls for 2 consecutive weeks AND step target is already being hit AND you've tried a small calorie adjustment first. Stack the levers in order: steps → calories → cardio duration → cardio frequency.

### Illness Prevention (You Got Sick Last Time)

Getting sick at ~4 weeks out likely meant your immune system was suppressed from the combined stress of deep deficit + high training volume + inadequate recovery. To prevent this:

- Never combine a calorie cut AND a cardio increase AND a volume increase in the same week
- Only change one variable at a time
- If you start feeling run down (sore throat, unusual fatigue, brain fog), take an immediate deload and add 200 kcal/day for 3–5 days. Losing 3 days of deficit is better than losing 2 weeks to illness.

## Posing Plan — Men's Physique Specific

### MP Mandatory Poses and Judging

Men's Physique uses **quarter turns**, not the mandatory bodybuilding poses. You will be judged on:

1. **Front pose** — relaxed but engaged. Shoulders slightly forward, abs tight, one arm slightly bent. V-taper, delt caps, abs, overall flow.
2. **Side turns (both)** — chest up, near arm relaxed or hand on hip, slight twist. Shoulder-to-waist ratio, posture, confidence.
3. **Back pose** — relaxed but lats slightly flared, shoulders wide, waist tight. Rear delt detail, lat width, taper.

**You also need:** a confident stage walk, smooth transitions between quarter turns, and natural facial expression (not grimacing like you're deadlifting).

### Posing Schedule

| Phase | Frequency | Duration | Focus |
|-------|:---------:|:--------:|-------|
| Weeks 28–16 | 2x/week | 10–15 min | Learn the quarter turns. Practice each pose individually. Hold 15–20s each. Film weekly. |
| Weeks 16–8 | 3–4x/week | 15–20 min | Transitions between poses. Stage walk practice. Compare to weekly progress photos. |
| Weeks 8–4 | 5x/week | 20 min | Full mock prejudging rounds. Practice under fatigue (post-cardio). Refine facial expression and arm positioning. |
| Weeks 4–0 | Daily | 20–30 min | Full routine with timing. Practice in board shorts you'll wear on stage. Film from multiple angles. |

### Vacuum Practice

Vacuums are trained 3x/week as part of your ab work (included in Day 2 programming). Start with 3 holds of 15–20 seconds, build to 30–60 second holds. A tight vacuum during front and side poses is a massive visual advantage in MP — it makes your waist look smaller and your shoulders look wider.

---

## Sleep and Recovery

- **Sleep target:** 7–8 hours per night. This is a requirement.
- **If sleep drops below 6 hours for 3+ consecutive nights:**
  1. Reduce caffeine and move cutoff to noon
  2. Reduce evening cardio if applicable
  3. Consider a mini-deload or temporary calorie bump before cutting harder
- **Job search stress:** You're prepping while actively interviewing. When interview stress peaks, the training plan bends — you don't add more volume or cardio to "make up for" a stressful week. Stress is cumulative. Your body doesn't separate work cortisol from training cortisol.
- **Water intake:** Consistent daily. 0.5–0.75 oz per lb bodyweight (~86–129 oz/day). Don't change water intake dramatically day to day.

---

## Peak Week (To Be Programmed at Week 6)

Peak week details will be added when:

- You are visibly lean enough that manipulation will make a difference
- You have stable data on how your body handles carbs, sodium, and water

**Principles decided now (specifics decided later):**

- Keep water and sodium consistent. Do not dehydrate. Dehydrated natural competitors look flat and worse, not better.
- Small carb manipulation based on visual assessment (mirror, not scale)
- Avoid extreme depletion workouts
- Final training: light pump session 1–2 days before stage
- Practice board short fit, tanning, and backstage logistics before show day
- Peak week goal: look 5% better. Not a coin flip between 20% better and 20% worse.

## NPC vs. Natural Federation Decision

This should be decided by Week 20 at the latest (registration deadlines, drug testing protocols, and show calendars vary).

| Factor | NPC | Natural (WNBF, OCB, NANBF, etc.) |
|--------|-----|-----------------------------------|
| Drug testing | Polygraph only (if tested at all) | Urinalysis + polygraph. Some require 7-year natural history. |
| Competition | Larger fields, more competitors | Smaller fields, more even playing field |
| Stage conditioning | Judges may expect harder conditioning | More reasonable conditioning expectations |
| Creatine | Allowed | Allowed in most federations (verify) |
| Show availability | More frequent, more locations | Fewer shows, may require travel |

> If you are lifetime natural and your goal is fair competition, a tested natural federation is likely the better experience. If you want the largest stage and don't mind potentially competing against enhanced athletes, NPC gives you more options.

## Weekly Check-In Protocol

Every 7 days (same day, same conditions), assess:

- [ ] 7-day average weight (trend direction and rate of loss)
- [ ] Waist measurement (at navel, fasted, morning)
- [ ] Top set performance on the 3 tracked compounds (incline bench, squat, pull-up)
- [ ] Sleep quality (hours + subjective 1–10)
- [ ] Hunger and energy (subjective 1–10)
- [ ] Step average for the week (are you hitting target?)
- [ ] Progress photos: front relaxed, front flexed (MP front pose), side, back relaxed, back lats flared — same lighting, same time, same location
- [ ] Posing practice completed (yes/no + duration)
- [ ] Cheat meal / refeed tracked (yes/no + approximate kcal)

> **Red flag rule:** If 3 or more indicators are trending negatively for 2 consecutive weeks, something needs to change. Adjust one variable (calories, steps, cardio, or volume) — not all of them at once.

## Strong App Logging Standards

Your Strong data has some gaps that reduce trackability. Fix these going forward:

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Assisted pull-ups/dips logged with 0 or inconsistent weight | Always log the **assistance weight** the machine is set to. As assistance decreases, that's progress. (Note: now doing BW pull-ups, so this mainly applies to assisted dips.) |
| No RPE logged | Add RPE to at least your **top set on compounds** each session. Use the notes field in Strong. |
| Inconsistent week-to-week tonnage (21k–117k range) | The structured program should normalize this. Flag any week that deviates >30% from the prior week. |
| Session duration unreliable | Not critical, but try to log start/end time manually if Strong isn't capturing it. |

## Week-by-Week Summary

| Day | Training | Cardio | Posing |
|-----|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Upper A — Chest + Back (Heavy) | — | — |
| 2 | Lower — Squat + Hinge + Accessories | — | — |
| 3 | Rest | Steps + LISS (if scheduled) | 10–15 min (Phase 2+) |
| 4 | Upper B — Shoulders + Arms | — | — |
| 5 | Upper C — Back + Rear Delts | Post-session LISS (if scheduled) | — |
| 6 | Rest | Steps | 15–20 min |
| 7 | Active Recovery | LISS (if scheduled) | 20–30 min (primary activity) |

## What's Different This Time

| Last Prep | This Prep |
|-----------|-----------|
| No step tracking | Daily step target from Week 1 |
| No structured cardio | Phased LISS with clear escalation rules |
| Untracked weekly cheat meal | Structured refeed, accounted for in weekly calories |
| No posing practice | 2x/week from Day 1, daily by Week 8 |
| Got sick at 4 weeks out | Deload schedule + illness prevention protocol + single-variable adjustments |
| Showed up 4 weeks behind | Weekly check-ins with early warning triggers at Week 12 |
| Training not competition-specific | MP-biased volume: delts and back prioritized, legs maintained |
| General hypertrophy split (chest/bicep days) | V-taper focused split with weak point days |
| %-based progression with AMRAP tests | Simple double progression with RPE tracking |
| Inconsistent volume week-to-week (21k–117k tonnage) | Structured volume with scheduled deloads |
| ~3.75 days/week frequency | 5 days/week with frequency ramp-up |
| No lateral delt emphasis | 14–16 sets/week lateral delt priority |
| Assisted pull-ups only | Bodyweight pull-ups → weighted pull-up progression |
| Strength baseline unknown mid-prep | Benchmark hold targets defined for Phase 2–3 |

## Starting Weight Quick Reference Card

**Phase 1 top-set starting points (conservative — room to progress):**

| Exercise | Starting Weight | Progression Target by Week 16 |
|----------|:--------------:|:-----------------------------:|
| Incline Bench Press (BB) | 155 lb × 5–8 | 175+ lb × 5–8 |
| Barbell Squat | 245 lb × 5–8 | 275+ lb × 5–8 (hold here) |
| Pull-Up (BW) | BW × 8–12 | BW+10 lb × 8–10 |
| Chest-Supported Row | 45 lb DBs × 8–12 | 55+ lb DBs × 8–12 |
| Romanian Deadlift | 185 lb × 8–12 | 205+ lb × 8–12 |
| Cable Lateral Raise | 15–20 lb × 12–15 | 25+ lb × 12–15 |

> These are starting points, not ceilings. Push the logbook in Phase 1. The strength you build now is the muscle you preserve later.
